# Amazon clone

Emmanuel and I created an Amazon clone were a user has the same experience as the Amazon website.  

## Features

1. Sign-In / Sign-Out
   - The user can create an account including email and password. If the user forgets the password he can request an email be sent to them to change the password.
2. Buy/Remove products from cart
   - The user can add and remove as many products to the cart as they want. Also we made it possible for them to click on a single button to proceed to checkout if thats all they want to purchase.
3. Carousel on the home page displaying advertisements
   - Recreated the carousel of the current advertisements of the Amazon site.
4. Navbar/Search Input
   - The Navbar has a couple features: login/logout, shopping cart, and also a search bar where the user can search for a particular product to add to their cart.
5. Account Page / change sign-in info
   - The user can change their personal login information like: email, password, and name.
